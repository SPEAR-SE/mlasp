# MLASP - Machine Learning Assisted System Performance and Capacity Prediction Based on Configuration Parameter Values
This repository contains the open-source system experimental data (code and test data) used as part of a research project conducted by members of the SPEAR lab at Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The contents of this repository are provided "as-is" without further support. In other words, it is expected of the user to have sufficient Python (and ML) related knowledge to understand what the code does and how it works.

NOTES:
- The source code and test data is provided only for the open source system
- The source code is in Jupyter notebook format
- The notebooks expect to have an environment with all dependencies pre-installed.
- The batch run notebook has hardcoded the value of the Jupyter virtual environment to tf-cpu. Please adjust according to your environment settings.
